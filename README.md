# Todo App

This is a simple web app that allows you to create and manage a list of todo items. You can add new items to the list, view all the items, and delete items that you no longer need.

# Getting Started

To use the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You should see a form where you can enter a new todo item and a list of all the items that you have added.

# Usage

To add a new todo item, enter the item in the input field and click the "Add" button. The item will be added to the list and displayed on the screen.

To view all the todo items, simply scroll down the page. Each item will be displayed in a separate row with a "Delete" button next to it.

To delete a todo item, click the "Delete" button next to the item that you want to remove. The item will be removed from the list and will no longer be displayed on the screen.
